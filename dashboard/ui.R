  "Outcome Metric: Your key metric is either continuous (e.g., revenue per user) or a percentage/rate (e.g., conversion).",
  "Bayesian Prior: You have historical data or domain knowledge to form a prior belief about variant performance.",
  "Immediate Feedback: You can measure outcomes quickly after exposure (e.g., not long-term retention studies)."
)
